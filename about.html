<div class="about">
   <p>The Mechanical Poet is an investigation into the construction of poetry. </p>
   The poems hosted on this site draw from a database of phonetically mapped lines culled from Project Gutenberg&#39;s collection of ebooks. 
   Depending on the constrains specified, the script can generate quatrains or sonnets, combining snippets from sources as diverse as <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31367">The Training of a Forester</a> and Swift&#39;s <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12252">Prose Works</a> to form new meanings. </p>
   <p>This project won &quot;most creative&quot; at ADI&#39;s <a href="http://adicu.com/02-08-2014/devfest-end.html">DevFest</a>.</p>
   <p>Both the back end scripts and the front end Jekyll site are available on <a href="https://github.com/mgorenstein/mechanicalpoet">GitHub</a>.</p>
   <p>The Mechanical Poet is a <a href="http://markgorenste.in/">Mark Gorenstein</a> original.</p>
